# Kentucky Traffic Stop Simulator - PWA Setup Guide

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Generate PWA icons (optional - fallback icons included)
npm run generate-icons

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## PWA Features

✓ **Offline Support** - Works without internet after first load
✓ **Installable** - Add to home screen on mobile/desktop
✓ **Data Persistence** - Documentation saves to localStorage
✓ **Fast Loading** - Service worker caching

## Development

The app will run at `http://localhost:5173` by default.

### Testing PWA Installation

1. Run `npm run build && npm run preview`
2. Open in Chrome/Edge: `http://localhost:4173`
3. Look for install icon in address bar
4. Click to install as standalone app

### Mobile Testing

1. Build and deploy to a hosting service (Netlify, Vercel, etc.)
2. Open on mobile browser (HTTPS required for PWA)
3. Tap "Add to Home Screen" when prompted

## PWA Icons

Icons can be auto-generated with:
```bash
npm run generate-icons
```

Or manually create:
- `public/pwa-192x192.png` - 192x192px
- `public/pwa-512x512.png` - 512x512px
- `public/apple-touch-icon.png` - 180x180px
- `public/favicon.ico` - 32x32px

Use the `public/icon.svg` as a template.

## Deployment

### Netlify
```bash
npm run build
# Deploy the 'dist' folder
```

### Vercel
```bash
npx vercel
```

### GitHub Pages
```bash
npm run build
# Deploy 'dist' folder to gh-pages branch
```

## Service Worker

The service worker is automatically generated by `vite-plugin-pwa` during build.
It caches all assets for offline use.

## Browser Support

- Chrome/Edge 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

## Troubleshooting

**PWA not installing?**
- Must be served over HTTPS (or localhost)
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure manifest.json is accessible

**Icons not showing?**
- Run `npm run generate-icons`
- Check files exist in `public/` folder
- Clear browser cache

**Offline mode not working?**
- Build app first: `npm run build`
- Service workers only work in production mode
- Check Application tab in DevTools
